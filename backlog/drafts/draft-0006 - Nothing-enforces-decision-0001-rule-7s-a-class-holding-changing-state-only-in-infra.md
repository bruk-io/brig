## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
TASK-0001.04 closed the brig-class-forms gaps for the inheritance restriction (a new 'brig-class-forms-disallowed-base' trait provider in pypeeker_rules/brig.py) and for the @dataclass frozen=True check. Rule 7 has a third clause -- 'A class holding changing state only in infra/, its invariant in its docstring' -- which TASK-0001.04's description named as part of the brig-class-forms gap but its AC#1 wording did not cover, so it closed neither enforced nor recorded. A bare 'class Foo:' that bundles mutable state, anywhere under src/brig/domain or src/brig/presentation, passes 'just gates' today. Evidence: pypeeker_rules/brig.py _declares_disallowed_base only inspects declared bases; _non_frozen_dataclasses only inspects @dataclass decorators; no rule part looks at a class's file_path for statefulness.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Either brig-class-forms rejects a stateful class outside infra/, with a planted-violation test, or a decision record says why that clause of rule 7 stays a review-time concern
<!-- AC:END -->
