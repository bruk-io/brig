## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
From bh-02's port onto bruk-io/brig v0.1.0: this brig has no darwin jail, so bh-02's runner:confined refuses on a Mac and points at runner:unconfined (bh-02 TASK-0196). The old in-repo brig (bh-02 commit d0c3a416 (its in-repo libs/brig, removed by bh-02's port to this brig), libs/brig/src/brig/mech and core) had a Seatbelt jail, measured on a Mac, with decision-207 (its Seatbelt pins) and decision-208. Owner of bh-02, 2026-10-31: built when a Mac run can prove it; on 2026-11-10: fine for the Mac jail not to work for now.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 On darwin, a jail confines a process's writes and network as the spec grades them, measured on a Mac
- [ ] #2 bh-02's runner:confined runs jailed on a Mac again
<!-- AC:END -->
